        <h2 class="secHeading">Adventure Time</h2>
        <p class="text">
          An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is
          typically bold, sometimes risky.Adventures may be activities with
          danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing,
          scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports. Adventures are
          often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to
          achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only
          be obtained by such activities. <br /><br />
          Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the
          purposes of recreation or excitement: examples are adventure racing
          and adventure tourism. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains
          in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the
          British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw
          global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental
          constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. Adventure
          education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.The pilot sits in a harness
          or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing.
          Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air
          entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of
          the air flowing over the outside.em labore provident dolorum, velit
          omnis mollitia eos adipisci! <br /><br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFNG</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing’s roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport
          was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from
          royalty to commoners. Early European explorers and travelers praised
          the skills of Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned
          to the islands disapproved of the “constant intermingling, without any
          restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime. Surfing
          was practiced only sporadically in Hawaii by the end of the 19th
          century. <br /><br />
          Early board design impeded the development of surfing. The typical
          surfboard ridden by Kahanamoku’s generation was solid wood, was 8–10
          feet (2–3 metres) long, 24 inches (61 cm) wide, and 3 inches (8 cm)
          thick, and weighed 100 pounds (45 kg). Rudimentary designs and a lack
          of fins made the boards extremely difficult to maneuver. Most surfers
          simply pointed their craft shoreward and made no attempt at steering.
